[Questions & Answers]

My terminal is saying 404 and then a random word, is that normal?
Yes it is, 404 means that its an invalid code. when it says 200, itll automaticly add to success.txt

It keeps saying 429 : {code} too many requests
This is also normal, just let it do its thing

Who do i send my words.txt file to when im done?
EvilAndStuff through reddit Dm's 

how do i transfer the words from data/success.txt to words.txt?
just copy and paste it to the end of the codes.

Ive ran the code for xx minutes and im still not getting any codes!!
Its going to take a while to find codes as there are so many words in the english 
language, just leave it to run while you go about your day. expect an average of 
~1 code per 15 minutes
